Subject: Confusion Regarding HW 1 Due Date for Intro Class

Good afternoon professor, I hope everything is going well. 

Today I checked my email to find a post from Piazza saying you have graded HW 1. I hadn't turned it in when I received the email, as I was under the impression that it was due on the 10th (tomorrow). In fact, in an email I received from a Piazza post that you posted, you mentioned that it is in fact due on the 10th. After looking back on the post, I saw that you did indeed change it to be due today, the 9th, at 11 AM. Since this was just a comment on that post, I must have missed it, and I guess I must have misheard in class when it was posted on the most recent side deck.

I understand that this is my fault for not getting the correct date, and I understand if you still don't want to accept it, but given the confusion, and the fact that it's the first assignment, I was hoping that you could make an exception. I know that you explicitly mentioned that late HW will not be accepted, so I understand if you deny this request. As of right now, the HW has been checked into GitHub if you decide to look at it.

Please let me know what you decide.

Thanks, and Shana Tova,
-Ophir Amon
